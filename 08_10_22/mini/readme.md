The goal of my project was to bring randomized txt from one api and randomized images from another.
Using a some what add-hoc and agile approach i went in with a tile and error mindset to find the best solutions i could.
Using two separate api to call different kinds of information. one api to call randomly generated posts and the second api to0 call a random image.
both apis combined are used to dynamically populate a card to act as a random post.
the card is populated buy using a html template and placed onm the page with a button tied to the add card function
